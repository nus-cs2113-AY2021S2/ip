## Quick start
> **Prerequisites:** Ensure that you have **Java 11** or above installed in your Computer.


### For new user
Set up _JARVIS_ as follows:
1. Create an empty folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for _JARVIS_.
1. Download the latest `JARVIS.jar` from [here](https://github.com/iamakilahamed/ip/releases).
1. Copy the jar file to the folder you created earlier.
1. Open a command window to that folder.
1. Run the command `java -jar JARVIS.jar` (i.e., run the command in the same folder as the jar file).
1. If the setup is correct, you should see something like the output below after approximately 5 seconds.

   ```

   Importing all preferences from home interface.
   Synchronising from the cloud.
   Systems are now fully operational.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
       Hello, sir. J.A.R.V.I.S. at your service.
   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
       Unfortunately, I could not detect any files in the database!
       But don't worry sir.
       I will create the files you might be needing later.
   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   ```
1. Type the command in the command window and press Enter to execute it. Refer to 
   [Features](README.md#features) below for details of each command.   

### For existing user
Open _JARVIS_ as follows:
1. Open a command window to the _home folder_ where you have copied `JARVIS.jar`.
1. Run the command `java -jar JARVIS.jar` (i.e, run the command in the same folder as the jar file).
1. If you already have a `jarvis.txt` in the folder containing the jar file, you should see something like the output 
  below after approximately 5 seconds.
   
   ```

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   ```
   However, if you do not have a `jarvis.txt` in the folder containing the jar file, you should see something like the
   output below after approximately 5 seconds.

## Features
> **Note:**
> * Command should always be in `lower_case`. It is always the first word supplied by the user.
> 
>   e.g. `list`, `todo TASK` and `delete 3`.
> 
> 
> * Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.
>
>   e.g. in `todo TASK`, `TASK` is a parameter which can be used as `todo task 1`.
> 
> 
> * Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `list` and `bye`) will be ignored. 
> 
>    e.g. if the command specifies `bye 123`, it will be interpreted as `bye`.
> 
> 
> * Whenever the task list is updated, `jarvis.txt` will be automatically updated if it already exists in the same
>   directory as the `JARVIS.jar` file. If `jarvis.txt` is missing, it will be automatically created within the same
>   directory as the jar file.

## FAQ
**Q:** How do I transfer my data to another computer?

**A:** The `jarvis.txt` is a text file and can be easily transferred from one computer to another through cloud-based 
       storage platforms like Google Drive for example. To install JARVIS, follow steps 1 to 3 of 
       [For new user](README.md#for-new-user) or you can directly download the latest `JARVIS.jar` 
       [here](https://github.com/iamakilahamed/ip/releases) if you are an experienced JARVIS user.
