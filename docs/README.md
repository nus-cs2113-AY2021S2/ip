# Duke User Guide
Duke is an application that helps to keep track of the user's tasks. 
Particularly, **"Todo", "Deadlines" and "Events"**. This application 
focuses on using Command Line Interface(CLI). Users are able to add 
each task with a date and time to remind them of the deadlines and/or 
upcoming events. There are multiple functions such as **"list", "delete", 
"done","find"** to help user better manage their tasks. 

Whatever changes in the data will be automatically saved and updated into a text file. When the user reboots the application all 
their data will be retrieved from this text file and shown to the user upon request. Be aware that all commands are **case sensitive**.
