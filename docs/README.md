## Introduction 
 _____     
Duke is a Command Line Interface (CLI) task manager application. 
It can help you to keep track of your todos, deadlines and events. 
You can easily add and delete tasks with just a few simple commands. 
Duke can also help you to mark your tasks as done once you have successfully completed them.
Need to bring your tasks list around?
Dukes got you covered by saving your task list as a text file in your local storage when you exit and loads it with every start up.
