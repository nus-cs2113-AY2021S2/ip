## Quick Start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

2. Download the latest `ip.jar` from [here](https://github.com/brandonfoong/ip/releases/), under `Assets > ip.jar`.

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for Duke.

4. Open an instance of your Terminal/Command Prompt/Powershell. In Windows 10, this can be done by right clicking an empty space in the File Manager, then selecting "Open Powershell window here".

5. Copy the following command into your terminal and press Enter to start Duke: `java -jar ip.jar`
    - Duke will automatically try to import a previous session's task information from the file `./data/duke.csv`.
    - If Duke is unable to open the file for reading, it will immediately terminate. To prevent this from happening, please ensure that you do not have the `./data/duke.csv` open in other programs (e.g. Excel).

6. You will see a welcome message, and Duke will prompt you to enter a command. A list of commands can be found by typing **`help`** and then pressing Enter. Some sample commands you can try:
    - `list`: Lists all tasks that you've added
    - `todo try out this app`: Adds a new task to the list with the description "try out this app"
    - `delete 1`: Deletes the 1st task in the list
    - `clear`: Clears all previously added tasks
    - `bye`: Exits the app

7. Refer to the Features below for details of each command.

2. If `TASK_NUMBER` does not follow the specification above, Duke will show an error message and not execute the command.

Examples:

If we run `done 2` in the sample instance in the `list` command above, it will mark the 2nd task as done and produce the following output:

	____________________________________________________________
	 Nice! I've marked this task as done:
	 [T][X] sleep
	____________________________________________________________

### `find` - List all matching tasks

Searches for all tasks matching the search expression, and shows them in an enumerated list. If no tasks match the search criteria, Duke will inform the user.

Format: 

`find SEARCH_EXPRESSION`

If we run `find ea` in the sample instance in the `list` command above, it will produce the following output:

```	
	____________________________________________________________
	 Here are the matching tasks in your list:

	 2. [T][ ] repeat
	____________________________________________________________
```
