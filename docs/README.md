# User Guide

## Introduction
PANDA is a basic task manager that runs on a Command Line Interface (CLI).
With PANDA, you can add, view and find things you need to do as well as 
important deadlines and events. Finished a task? Great! Mark it as done. 
Task no longer relevant? Delete it from the list. PANDA gives you a simple way to
maintain a list of your everyday tasks.

<br><br>

## FAQ
**Q: Does PANDA save the tasks I added after I stop the program?**
<br>
**A:** Yes! PANDA saves all changes made after each run and loads the previous 
task list before each run, in order to maintain your list of tasks. 
So if you don't see any messages about saving/loading, that's a good thing :D
<br><br>

**Q: Where can I view this list of tasks outside of PANDA??**
<br>
**A:** You can find it in the `data` folder that should be automatically created on the first run
(in the same folder `panda.jar` is located). The file name is `tasks.txt`. Do note however that PANDA
saves your tasks in a different format than is displayed when running the program.
For example, if you followed all the example commands on this user guide in the 
same order, opening `tasks.txt` shows something like this:

    E | 0 | Panda Club Fundraising 2021 | 6.00 pm
    D | 0 | sign up for Bamboo Eating Contest | 2021-12-02 | 23:59
