# duke.Duke project template

This is a project template for a greenfield Java project. It's named after the Java mascot _Duke_. Given below are instructions on how to use it.

## Setting up in Intellij

Prerequisites: JDK 11, update IntelliJ to the most recent version.

### On IntelliJ version 2020.3.1 (latest) and beyond

1. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project first)
1. Import the project into IntelliJ as follows:
   1. Click `Open`
   1. Select the project directory, and click `OK`
   1. If there are any further prompts, accept the defaults.
1. Configure the project to use **JDK 11** (not other versions) as explained in [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/sdk.html#set-up-jdk).
1. After that, locate the `src/main/java/duke.Duke.java` file, right-click it, and choose `Run duke.Duke.main()`. If the setup is correct, you should see something like the output below.

```
   Hello from
    ____        _        
   |  _ \ _   _| | _____ 
   | | | | | | | |/ / _ \
   | |_| | |_| |   <  __/
   |____/ \__,_|_|\_\___|
   
------------------------------------------
	Hello! I'm Duke
	What can I do for you?
------------------------------------------ 
```

## Running the JAR File on computer:
The **Duke** app is run via a file with the extension `.jar`. The following steps will help you set up **Duke** to run on your computer.

1. Set up the `.jar` file by downloading the latest version from [here](https://github.com/nivikcivik/ip/releases)
    1. Click on `Individual Project.jar` under the latest version (`v1.0` or beyond)
    1. Once the download prompt appears, `save` the file to your desired folder on your computer. This folder will be the _home folder_ for your tasks list.
 
1. Look for the `terminal` or `command prompt` application on your computer.
    1. Type `java --version` in the terminal on your computer to check the version of java and ensure its JDK 11.
    2. Locate your _home folder_ where you have saved the `.jar` file.
    3. Use commands `cd` to change directory ( or folder) and `ls` (or `dir` on command prompt on Windows) to view the files in your current directory.
 
1. Once you have entered the _home folder_, type the following command: `java -jar <name of .jar file>` e.g. `java -jar ip.jar`
1. You should see the **Duke** logo along with a welcome message.   
   **Duke** is now running!
    1. You would see this greeting message, for example:

```
   Hello from
    ____        _        
   |  _ \ _   _| | _____ 
   | | | | | | | |/ / _ \
   | |_| | |_| |   <  __/
   |____/ \__,_|_|\_\___|

	Hello! I'm Duke
	What can I do for you?

```
