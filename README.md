<a name="quickstart"></a>
### Quick Start
The **Duke** app is run via a file with the extension `.jar`. The following steps will help you set up **Duke** to run on your computer.
<a name="settingup"></a>
1. Set up the `.jar` file by downloading the latest version from [here](https://github.com/nivikcivik/ip/releases)
   1. Click on `ip.jar` under the latest version (`v0.1` or beyond)
   1. Once the download prompt appears, `save` the file to your desired folder on your computer. This folder will be the _home folder_ for your tasks list.

1. Ensure you have installed `Java 11` on your computer.
   1. Look for the `terminal` or `command prompt` application on your computer.
   1. Type `java --version` in the terminal on your computer to check the version of java.

### Running <span style="color:#2975C7">Duke</span> Program 
1. On the `terminal` or `command prompt`, locate your _home folder_ where you have saved the `.jar` file.
   1. Use commands `cd` to change directory ( or folder) and `ls` (or `dir` on command prompt on Windows) to view the files in your current directory.

1. Once you have entered the _home folder_, type the following command: `java -jar <name of .jar file>` e.g. `java -jar ip.jar`
1. You should see the **Duke** logo along with a welcome message.   
   **Duke** is now running!
   1. You would see this greeting message, for example:

```
I have created a file at this location:
C:\Users\user\Desktop\tasks.txt
to store all your tasks!
____________________________________________________________
Hello from
 ____        _        
|  _ \ _   _| | _____
| | | | | | | |/ / _ \
| |_| | |_| |   <  __/
|____/ \__,_|_|\_\___|

____________________________________________________________
Hello! I'm Duke :D Be nice to me:)

Your tasks list is saved here:
C:\Users\user\Desktop\tasks.txt
Type 'help' if you need help.
____________________________________________________________
   
```
1. If the _tasks.txt_ file does not already exist in the _home folder_ that you are in currently, **Duke** will tell you the file path where the _tasks.txt_ file is saved. It will be saved in your _home folder_ where your `.jar` file is located.

<a name="saving"></a>
### Saving of tasks list locally on your computer 
When the command `bye` is given to **Duke**, it will automatically save the current task list from the **Duke** program in the _tasks.txt_ file (located in your _home folder_ ; file path specified at beginning for the first time)  
However, you can manually enter the `save` command (refer to [**here**](#save))

<a name="editing"></a>
### Editing of tasks list locally on your computer 
``` 
T ~~   ~~ be happy
D ~~ X ~~ finish homework ~~ 23 Feb 2021 ~~ 23:59
E ~~   ~~ birthday party ~~ 28 Feb 2020 ~~ 23:59
```
When you open the _tasks.txt_ file, you will notice that your tasks are saved and are separated by the ' ~~ ' symbol. This is so that **Duke** can read your tasks data each time the program runs.

<span style="color:RED">**NOTE:**</span>. It is **highly discouraged** to edit this file directly instead of editing them on the **Duke** program, as it could cause some errors when **Duke** is loaded the next time. Simply change the individual fields (e.g. numbers on dates/times, the X icon, etc.).

Please do **not** change the line structure or the format of the file.

<a name="faq"></a>
### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

1. I lost my task list because I forcefully stopped the program. What can I do to prevent this?
   - Try to end the **Duke** program by entering the `bye` command in order to save the tasks array.
   - To prevent such errors, enter the `save` command if possible (refer to [**here**](#save)) to save your files before your program gets interrupted.

1. Where can I find my _tasks.txt_ file?
   - Usually, the _tasks.txt_ file will be saved in the same folder where your **Duke** program is located.
   - You may search on your computer locally for the file.
   - Enter the `print filepath` command in the Duke program to view the file path (refer to [**here**](#printfilepath)).

1. How do I edit the file path for _tasks.txt_ file?
   - The current version of **Duke** is not able to change the _tasks.txt_ file path. This feature may be implemented in future versions.

1. When I search for a keyword using the `find` command, or a particular task type using the `print` command, the list is **empty**.   
   I **only** see this output:
   ```
   ____________________________________________________________
   Here are the matching tasks in your list:
   ____________________________________________________________
   ```  
   What does this mean?
   - This simply means that  there are no results after searching through the tasks.
