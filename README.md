# _J.A.R.V.I.S._

_J.A.R.V.I.S._ (_JARVIS_) is a **cross-platform desktop task manager app, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI)**. 
If you can type fast, _JARVIS_ can manage your tasks faster than traditional Graphical User Interface (GUI) apps.

## Setting up _JARVIS_

**Prerequisites:** Ensure that you have **Java 11** or above installed in your Computer.

Set up _JARVIS_ as follows:
1. Create an empty folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for _JARVIS_.
1. Download the latest `JARVIS.jar` from [here](https://github.com/iamakilahamed/ip/releases).
1. Copy the jar file to the folder you created earlier.
1. Open a command window to that folder.
1. Run the command `java -jar JARVIS.jar` (i.e., run the command in the same folder as the jar file).
1. If the setup is correct, you should see something like the output below after approximately 5 seconds.

       I will create the files you might be needing later.
